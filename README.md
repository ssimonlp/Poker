# Poker Battle
## What do we have here ?
A small program counting how many wins player 1 has.

## How do I run the program?

    $ git clone https://github.com/ssimonlp/Poker.git
    $ cd poker
    $ bundle install (in case you want to run the tests)
    $ ruby poker.rb
    $ rspec spec/hand_spec.rb (again just for the tests)
